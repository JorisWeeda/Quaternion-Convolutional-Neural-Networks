# Quaternion-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
Quaternion Convolutional Neural Networks: A novel approach that extends traditional convolutional neural networks by introducing quaternions, a hypercomplex number system. The proposed method outperforms traditional CNNs on several image classification tasks while maintaining a similar number of parameters.
